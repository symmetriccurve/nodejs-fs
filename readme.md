Simple Node Script to delete zoom recording folders with less than 5 mints of recordings.


During my sessions,
I start recording from the start but sometimes students do not show up on time or I simply want to pause the recording for some time,

For every time you stop and start a recording a new .zoom file is created, this will eventually cluster the recording folder and takes spaces on disk.

This script helps me to delete those recordings which are less than 5 mints(Assuming the file size for 5 mints is less than 30MB)
